# Prompt Master Standalone — Python edition

Turn a one-line idea into a full LTX-Video 2.3 prompt, positive and negative,
generated locally by a Gemma model running in `llama.cpp`. Attach a reference
image and the same model looks at it while it writes.

This is [`RJSprod/LTX_Video_Prompts`](https://github.com/RJSprod/LTX_Video_Prompts)
distributed as Python source with a one-click installer, instead of as a
compiled `.exe` behind an Inno Setup wizard. The application, the prompt engine
and the prompts it produces are unchanged — see [Relationship to the packaged
build](#relationship-to-the-packaged-build).

## Install

Download or clone this repository, then run:

```
start_windows.bat
```

That is the whole install. It will:

1. find a Python 3.12 or 3.13 interpreter, or install a private one under
   `installer_files\conda` if the machine has none — verified against a pinned
   SHA-256, and without touching your PATH, registry or system Python;
2. build an isolated environment in `installer_files\env` and install the five
   dependencies;
3. ask you four questions (below) and download the model;
4. launch the application.

Re-running it is always safe — every step it has already done is skipped.

### The four questions

| Question | What it decides |
| --- | --- |
| **Installation directory** | Where the runtime, model, projector, cache and logs live. The model alone is 16–27 GiB, so this can be a different drive from the checkout. |
| **Which GPU** | Which card runs the model, and which pinned `llama.cpp` build gets downloaded — CUDA 12 or CUDA 13, chosen by compute capability. Skipped if you only have one. |
| **Model quality** | `Q4_K_M`, `Q6_K_P` or `Q8_K_P`. The default is sized from your VRAM, and each option shows its download size and whether it fits. |
| **A model you already have** | Optional. Point setup at a `.gguf` already on disk and it is installed from there instead of downloaded — see below. Answer no and everything downloads as before. |

### Using a model you already have

The model is one 16–27 GiB file, and a connection that cannot carry it is not
something setup can fix. If you already have that file — downloaded by hand,
copied from another install, or fetched with a download manager — hand it over:

```
python app.py --setup --model-file D:\models\Gemma4-...-Q6_K_P.gguf
```

or answer the fourth question and paste the path. Either way it is checked
against the same pinned SHA-256 as a download, then **moved** into the
installation directory rather than copied, so you are not left with two copies
of a 21 GiB file. `--keep-source` copies instead. If the vision projector sits
beside it — it usually does, both being files from the same repository — setup
offers to take that too, and anything not supplied is still downloaded normally.

A file that is not the pinned build is named rather than just rejected: "that is
the `Q4_K_M` build" is an answer, and setup offers to install it as what it is.
The same picker is on the Qt wizard's model page, for re-running setup later.

Nothing is downloaded before you confirm. Every artifact is pinned by URL and
verified by SHA-256 after download; interrupted downloads resume rather than
restart. A connection dropped mid-transfer — which a 16–27 GiB single file
invites — is retried from where it stopped rather than ending setup, and only
attempts that move no bytes at all count against the retry budget. Setup only
writes its state after it has generated one text prompt and one image prompt
successfully, so a half-finished install cannot be launched.

## Launch

```
python app.py
```

That is the command-line launch this repository exists to provide. It works from
any command prompt, from any directory, with whatever `python` is on your PATH —
`app.py` re-executes itself under the installed environment when it needs to, so
there is nothing to activate first.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `python app.py` | Open the application |
| `python app.py --setup` | Re-run the questions — change GPU, model or directory |
| `python app.py --version` | Print the version |
| `cmd_windows.bat` | Open a shell with the environment active, for `pytest` |
| `update_windows.bat` | Reinstall dependencies after pulling a new version |

For an unattended reinstall, every question has a flag:

```
python app.py --setup --dir D:\PromptMaster --gpu 0 --quant Q6_K_P --yes
```

`--model-file` and `--mmproj-file` install those from disk instead of
downloading them; a file that is not the pinned artifact stops an unattended run
rather than becoming an install that claims to be something it is not.
`--gpu-layers` is there too, for a card that cannot hold its quantization
entirely in VRAM.

## Using it

Type what you want in **Intent**, set whichever controls matter, and press
**Generate**. The positive prompt streams in as the model writes it; the
negative prompt is assembled from the engine's gated banks and, if **Smart
negative** is on, a second pass over the finished script.

**Attach an image** with *Browse image…* and the mode switches to image-to-video
automatically. The image is EXIF-normalised, converted to RGB, resized to 768px,
JPEG-encoded and sent in the same multimodal request as the text — the model
sees the still it is writing the first frame from. Image-to-video without an
image is refused rather than silently downgraded, because the two produce
different prompts.

Every control from the packaged build is present: 47 accents with 3 strengths,
35 music genres plus accent-matched auto, 20 visual styles in 4 groups, 10
cameras, 10 transitions, 3 output formats, POV, wardrobe and undress, a lexicon,
dialogue percentage, duration, FPS, dimensions, seed and extra negative terms.
Results copy to the clipboard or save to `.txt`.

## Requirements

- Windows x64
- An NVIDIA GPU with a current driver. The 3090 and 5090 are the pinned
  configurations; any other CUDA card is sized from its own VRAM and compute
  capability. There is no CPU path — inference runs on the GPU through
  `llama.cpp`.
- Roughly 20–30 GiB of disk for the model, plus ~1 GiB for the environment.
- Python 3.12 or 3.13 is used if present, and installed privately if not. A
  newer Python on the machine is skipped rather than used: the pinned
  dependencies publish no wheels for it — PySide6 6.8.1 stops at 3.13 — so the
  installer builds its environment on a version they cover instead. An
  environment left behind by an earlier run on an unsupported Python is
  rebuilt automatically the next time `start_windows.bat` runs.

## Relationship to the packaged build

The prompt engine is a vendored copy of
[Prompt Master LD](https://github.com/Brojakhoeman/Prompt-Master-LD), and this
repository does not touch it: `src/prompt_master/prompt_engine/` is
byte-identical to the packaged build, which is itself byte-identical to upstream
in 14 of 15 modules. The one approved difference is recorded in
[`UPSTREAM_DIFF_NOTES.md`](UPSTREAM_DIFF_NOTES.md) and the numbers are in
[`PARITY_REPORT.md`](PARITY_REPORT.md).

`prompt_engine/options.py` still builds every dropdown from the upstream
constants at import time, so no control can drift from the engine consuming its
value.

What changed, and only this:

| Area | Packaged build | Here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Distribution | Nuitka `.exe` + Inno Setup | Python source + `start_windows.bat` |
| Launch | `PromptMaster.exe` | `python app.py` |
| Setup questions | Qt wizard only | Console at install, Qt wizard still in Settings — both share one pipeline |
| Install root | Beside the frozen `.exe` | `install.json` beside `app.py`, so models can live on another drive |
| GPU support | RTX 3090 / 5090 only, others refused | Any NVIDIA card; 3090 and 5090 keep their exact pinned runtime and quantization |
| Where the model comes from | Downloaded, always | Downloaded, or installed from a `.gguf` you already have — against the same pinned SHA-256 |

Two behavioural changes, both bounded. The GPU widening is pinned so that it
cannot affect the two supported cards: `device_detection.PINNED` maps them to
their original runtime and quantization before any heuristic runs, and
`tests/test_install_flow.py` asserts that. Supplying a model changes where the
bytes come from and nothing else — the file is checked against the same pinned
hash a download is, and lands at the same path, so everything downstream of
setup cannot tell the two apart.

## Tests

```
python -m pytest tests/        # 554 passed
```

- `test_upstream_parity.py` (434) — the upstream self-test, ported
- `test_prompt_engine.py` (26) — the adapter seam and the UI option sources
- `test_core.py` (15) — multimodal requests, atomic JSON, SSE, zip-slip,
  download resume and retry
- `test_install_flow.py` (79) — install-root discovery, GPU sizing, manifest
  resolution, console setup, supplying a model from disk, and the installer's
  interpreter and environment checks

Output-level parity against an upstream checkout is checked separately:

```
python tools/compare_upstream_engine.py --upstream <checkout>   # 0 mismatches
python tools/check_upstream_sync.py     --upstream <checkout>   # 1 approved diff
```
